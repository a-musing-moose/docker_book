A Deep Dive into Docker for Development
=======================================

Overview
--------

Just getting started in development in any language attracts a significant learning curve. Ensuring what you are doing
along the way is best practice is even more difficult.

This applies not only to those learning a new language but also to those new to an established project or wishing to
start one that others can get up to speed on ASAP.

This is my journey to adapting my somewhat opinionated Python_ workflow to a world in which Docker_ exists.
